<objective>
Single unified command for autonomous milestone execution in Lazy mode.

**UX Philosophy:** Self-driving car metaphor - confirm settings, press go, walk away.

This command:
1. Validates mode (must be Lazy or unset)
2. Prompts for all safety settings (no --yes flag, user must confirm)
3. Detects existing plans vs need to plan (Plan 02)
4. Detects incomplete runs for resume (Plan 02)
5. Executes planning then ralph.sh autonomously (Plan 02)
</objective>

<step name="validate_mode">
**Step 0: Validate Mode**

Check that the user is in Lazy mode (or unset).

```bash
# Check for existing config
if [ -f ".planning/.ralph-config" ]; then
    source .planning/.ralph-config 2>/dev/null
fi
CURRENT_MODE="${GSD_MODE:-}"
```

**If CURRENT_MODE is "interactive":**
Show error and suggest alternative:

```
Error: /gsd:autopilot is only available in Lazy mode.

Current mode: interactive

In Interactive mode, use:
  /gsd:execute-phase  - Execute one phase at a time with supervision

Run /gsd:lazy-mode to switch to Lazy mode if you want autonomous execution.
```

**If CURRENT_MODE is "lazy" or empty:** Continue to next step.

The empty case is allowed (same pattern as plan-milestone-all) because the user may not have explicitly set a mode yet but intends to use autopilot.
</step>

<step name="prompt_settings">
**Step 1: Prompt for Settings**

ALWAYS prompt for all settings - no --yes flag or skip option.

Use prompt_all_settings pattern from budget.sh:

```bash
# Source budget library
source $HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/lib/budget.sh

# Load existing config as defaults, then prompt for all 4 settings
prompt_all_settings
```

This prompts for:
- MAX_ITERATIONS (default: 50)
- TIMEOUT_HOURS (default: 8)
- CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD (default: 5)
- STUCK_THRESHOLD (default: 3)

Each value:
- Shows current/default value as editable default (read -e -i)
- Validates as positive integer
- Saves to .planning/.ralph-config after all confirmed

After prompts, show confirmation summary:

```
Settings configured:
  Max iterations:      50
  Timeout hours:       8
  Circuit breaker:     5 failures before halt
  Stuck threshold:     3 retries on same task

Configuration saved to .planning/.ralph-config
```

User must consciously confirm settings before autonomous run begins.
</step>

<step name="detect_plans">
**Step 2: Detect Existing Plans**

Check if plans exist for all phases.

```bash
# Count phases in ROADMAP.md
TOTAL_PHASES=$(grep -cE "^### Phase [0-9]" .planning/ROADMAP.md || echo 0)

# Count phases with PLAN.md files
PHASES_WITH_PLANS=$(find .planning/phases -name "*-*-PLAN.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | sed 's|.*phases/||;s|/.*||' | sort -u | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

if [[ "$PHASES_WITH_PLANS" -lt "$TOTAL_PHASES" ]]; then
    PLANS_NEEDED=true
    echo "Plans needed: $((TOTAL_PHASES - PHASES_WITH_PLANS)) phase(s) without plans"
fi
```

**If plans exist for all phases:**

Prompt the user:
```
Plans exist for all phases.
Use existing plans or regenerate? [use/regenerate]
```

- If user selects "use": Skip planning, proceed to Step 3
- If user selects "regenerate": Proceed to Step 2b (planning)

**If plans are missing:**

Display message and proceed to planning:
```
Planning needed for {count} phase(s)
Proceeding to generate plans...
```
</step>

<step name="execute_planning">
**Step 2b: Execute Planning (if needed)**

When planning is required (missing plans or user chose regenerate), spawn the planning orchestrator.

Use Task tool to spawn plan-milestone-all:
```
Task(
  prompt="Run /gsd:plan-milestone-all with --skip-research flag",
  subagent_type="orchestrator",
  description="Generate all phase plans"
)
```

Wait for planning completion before proceeding.

**If planning fails:**
```
==========================================
 PLANNING FAILED
==========================================

Error: Could not generate phase plans.

Check .planning/ for partial output.
Review error above and retry with /gsd:autopilot
==========================================
```

Exit without proceeding to execution.

**If planning succeeds:**
```
Planning complete. Proceeding to execution...
```

Continue to Step 3.
</step>

<step name="detect_resume">
**Step 3: Detect Incomplete Runs**

Check STATE.md for prior incomplete execution.

```bash
# Check for iteration history with incomplete status
if [[ -f ".planning/STATE.md" ]]; then
    # Extract next action - if it's a plan ID (NN-MM), run is incomplete
    NEXT_TASK=$(grep "^Description:" .planning/STATE.md | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}' || echo "")

    if [[ -n "$NEXT_TASK" ]]; then
        INCOMPLETE_RUN=true
        echo "Incomplete run detected. Last position: $NEXT_TASK"
    fi
fi
```

**If incomplete run detected:**

Prompt the user:
```
==========================================
 INCOMPLETE RUN DETECTED
==========================================

Previous execution stopped at: {NEXT_TASK}

Resume from this position or restart from the beginning?
[resume/restart]
```

- If user selects "resume": Proceed with existing STATE.md position
- If user selects "restart": Reset STATE.md position to first plan (01-01)

**If no incomplete run:**

Continue to Step 4 (fresh execution).
</step>

<step name="execute">
**Step 4: Launch in New Terminal**

Display launch confirmation with settings summary:

```
==========================================
 GSD AUTOPILOT - READY TO LAUNCH
==========================================

Mode: Lazy (autonomous)
Plans: {count} across {phases} phases
Settings:
  - Max iterations: {MAX_ITERATIONS}
  - Timeout: {TIMEOUT_HOURS}h
  - Circuit breaker: {CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD} failures
  - Stuck threshold: {STUCK_THRESHOLD} retries

Launching ralph.sh in new terminal window...
==========================================
```

**Launch ralph.sh in a new terminal window:**

Use the terminal-launcher module to spawn ralph.sh in a detached terminal:

```bash
node $HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/lib/terminal-launcher.js
```

Alternatively via Node.js in Bash tool:
```bash
node -e "const launcher = require(process.env.HOME + '/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/lib/terminal-launcher.js'); const result = launcher.launchTerminal(); process.exit(result.success ? 0 : 1);"
```

**Capture the result:**
- If exit code 0: Terminal launched successfully, proceed to Step 5 success
- If exit code 1: Terminal launch failed, manual instructions already displayed

**Important:** Do NOT wait for ralph.sh to complete. The terminal-launcher spawns a detached process and returns immediately. This is the execution isolation feature.
</step>

<step name="completion">
**Step 5: Handle Launch Result**

Parse the result from terminal-launcher and display appropriate message.

**Success (exit 0 from launcher):**
```
==========================================
 GSD AUTOPILOT - LAUNCHED
==========================================

Ralph.sh is now running in a new terminal window.

You can now close this Claude session - execution continues independently.

To monitor progress:
  - Watch the new terminal window
  - Check .planning/STATE.md for status
  - Run /gsd:progress after completion

When ralph.sh completes:
  - Review work in .planning/phases/
  - Run /gsd:complete-milestone when ready
==========================================
```

**Failure (exit 1 from launcher):**
```
==========================================
 GSD AUTOPILOT - MANUAL LAUNCH REQUIRED
==========================================

Could not auto-launch terminal window.
Manual instructions were displayed above.

After starting ralph.sh manually:
  - Watch the terminal for progress
  - Check .planning/STATE.md for status
  - Run /gsd:progress after completion
==========================================
```

**Note:** Unlike the previous inline execution, we no longer handle STUCK/ABORTED/INTERRUPTED exit codes here. Those conditions are now handled by ralph.sh in its own terminal window. The autopilot command simply launches and exits.
